## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The goal is to develop a stock inventory management system. The Stock Inventory Management will allow users or staff of the COTR church purchasing department to obtain information about what they have in stock, quantities, who the suppliers are, prices and when is necessary to supply or buy a specific product with only a few clicks on their computers; therefore, it will reduce the use of paperwork, delays in purchases, difficulties in keeping records, and increase the efficiency of the purchasing process and warehouse management.
Currently, the church purchasing department performs all these processes manually. They receive from consumers (people who work in general services, cleaning, church ushers) the notification or requirements when there is no product in the warehouse or many times, they think to have a product, but when they verify its existence, it is expired. This generates discomfort and delay in activities or pending work and to make or hasty purchases without any prior price or quality analysis. This situation occurs mainly with consumers of cleaning products, food, and general services.

### Features
Create user, verify, and change password.
Create items, providers, consumers, and also, allow the user updates, delete or remove these.
Generate report of products in stock, expired products, and product pending to order or for buying.

### Technologies
C#
SQL for database
For Front-end I am not sure so far what I could use, perhaps JavaScript or Azure

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn some language or technology that allow me to present the product final in a friendly platform for the users such as Azure or another.
